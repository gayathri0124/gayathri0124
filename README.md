### 💼 What I Do

I build systems that make data useful, accessible, and actionable — across web, mobile, and ML platforms.

💡 **Machine Learning & AI**  
- Built ML apps with 93%+ accuracy for real-time plant disease detection  
- Designed LLM-powered ad ranking systems and health assistants  
- Applied NumPy, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, OpenCV, and Streamlit for modeling and deployment  
- Used cosine similarity, embeddings, and real-world feedback loops to improve model outputs  

📱 **Mobile Application Development**  
- Built cross-platform React Native apps with WebView and PDF preview/download  
- Engineered secure, scalable PDF generation via Node.js + AWS S3 + Base64  
- Integrated real-time test reports and health data into mobile interfaces  

🧪 **Software Development & DevOps**  
- Designed full-stack platforms using Node.js, React, SQL, and microservices  
- Automated ticket triage pipelines (reduced manual load by 40%)  
- Containerized workloads using Docker and deployed modular services on Linux  
- Worked in Agile teams using Jira, GitHub Actions, CI/CD workflows  

📊 **Data Analysis & Dashboards**  
- Built logistics dashboards with route optimization and delay prediction  
- Visualized performance KPIs and trends using Power BI, Pandas, and Plotly  
- Designed interactive health dashboards tied to ML outputs and location data
